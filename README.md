# Coffee PHP - Extension

![Build](https://github.com/Coffee-PHP/Extension/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

Auto-loads extensions that add functionality to PHP.

These extensions include global functions
such as array_get_* functions
for safely retrieving data from an array,

var_get_* functions for safely casting
a mixed type to concrete type,

as well as other useful functions.
